<h1 id="What-is-the-object-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-object-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the object of the game?"></a>What is the object of the game?</h1><p>Pen and paper is a two player game where each player has 21 pieces of paper.

<h1 id="What-inspired-the-game’s-design"><a href="#What-inspired-the-game’s-design" class="headerlink" title="What inspired the game’s design?"></a>What inspired the game’s design?</h1><p>When developing Cuphead, we were inspired by classic 1930s cartoons. We wanted to capture that vintage look and feel, while also incorporating our own unique style.</p>
<p>A big part of that was creating an interesting and challenging boss fight experience. We wanted players to feel like they were really testing their skills against these powerful creatures.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we developed a unique boss battle mechanics system that allows for a high degree of flexibility and creativity. This ensures that each boss is different and provides a fresh challenge for players.</p>

Some players try to win by playing the best hand possible every time. Other players try to bluff their opponents into folding their hands. There are many different strategies that players can use in order to win.</p>
<p>One way for a player to win is by having the best hand at the end of the hand. This can be done by playing the best cards that they have, or by bluffing their opponents into folding. If a player can get all of their opponents to fold, then they will automatically win the hand.</p>
<p>Another way for a player to win is by taking down all of the pots at the table. This can be done by winning a lot of hands in a row, or by bluffing everyone out of their money. If a player is able to take down all of the pots, they will automatically win the game.</p>
<p>A player can also win by forcing everyone else at the table to fold. This can be done by playing very aggressively, or by playing very tight and only betting when they have a good hand. If a player is able to make all of their opponents fold, they will automatically win the game.</p>
