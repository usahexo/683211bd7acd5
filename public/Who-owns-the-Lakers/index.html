        <h1 id="Who-owns-the-Lakers"><a href="#Who-owns-the-Lakers" class="headerlink" title="Who owns the Lakers?"></a>Who owns the Lakers?</h1><p>The Lakers are a professional basketball team based in Los Angeles, California. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league’s Western Conference Pacific Division. The Lakers have won 16 championships, the second-most in NBA history.</p>
<p>The Lakers were founded in 1948 as the Minneapolis Lakers. The team moved to Los Angeles in 1960. The Lakers are owned by Jeanie Buss and Jamie McCourt.</p>
<p>On February 7, 2008, Jerry Buss, the owner of the Lakers, died after a long battle with cancer. His son Jim Buss took over as the executive vice president of basketball operations for the Lakers. On August 14, 2013, Jeanie Buss was named the new controlling owner of the Lakers. Jamie McCourt is the president of business operations for the Lakers.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-they-ownership-work"><a href="#How-do-they-ownership-work" class="headerlink" title="How do they ownership work?"></a>How do they ownership work?</h1><p>The ownership of a company is determined by the number of shares that are issued. The shareholders are the owners of the company and they are the ones who elect the board of directors. The board of directors is responsible for managing the company on behalf of the shareholders.</p>
<p>The shareholders have certain rights, including the right to vote on important matters and the right to receive dividends. They also have a responsibility to act in the best interests of the company. This includes voting in favor of proposals that will benefit the company and not selling their shares when it would be harmful to the company.</p>
<p>There are different types of shares, which include common stock and preferred stock. Common stock is more risky but also has greater potential rewards. Preferred stock is less risky but pays a fixed dividend rate.</p>
<p>Shares can be sold privately or on an exchange. The price at which they are sold depends on supply and demand. Companies typically sell new shares to raise money for expansion or to repay debt.</p>
<p>Shares can also be transferred to another person. This happens when someone sells their shares to another person or when they die and their shares are transferred to their heirs.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-main-stakeholders-in-the-team"><a href="#Who-are-the-main-stakeholders-in-the-team" class="headerlink" title="Who are the main stakeholders in the team?"></a>Who are the main stakeholders in the team?</h1><p>The main stakeholders in a team are typically the people who have the most at stake. This could be because they have a lot to lose, or they have a lot to gain. For example, the team’s founder or CEO may be a major stakeholder, as they have the most to lose if the team fails. Other major stakeholders might be investors, key team members, or customers.</p>
<p>It’s important to identify and understand the motivations of all major stakeholders in order to create a cohesive and successful team. Each stakeholder will likely have their own goals and interests, which may not always coincide with those of other stakeholders. It’s essential to find a way for everyone’s goals to align if the team is going to succeed.</p>
<p>Often, the best way to do this is by developing a shared vision and purpose for the team. This provides everyone with something to strive for and helps them work together towards a common goal. By understanding and accommodating the needs of all stakeholders, you can create a winning team that is poised for success.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-did-the-Lakers-sell-for-in-2012"><a href="#How-much-did-the-Lakers-sell-for-in-2012" class="headerlink" title="How much did the Lakers sell for in 2012?"></a>How much did the Lakers sell for in 2012?</h1><p>The Lakers were sold in 2012 for $2 billion. This was a record-breaking sale at the time and made the Lakers one of the most valuable franchises in all of sports.</p>
<h1 id="Who-has-the-most-control-over-the-team"><a href="#Who-has-the-most-control-over-the-team" class="headerlink" title="Who has the most control over the team?"></a>Who has the most control over the team?</h1><p>In a sport like basketball, the answer to this question is clear. The coach has the most control over the team. He decides who plays, what plays are called, and how the team practices. There is no question that the coach is the most important person on the team.</p>
<p>But what about in other sports? Who has the most control over the team? In football, it’s the quarterback. He calls the plays and makes sure that everyone is in position. He is also responsible for getting the ball to the right players at the right time. In baseball, it’s the pitcher. He sets up each pitch and decides when to throw different pitches. He also controls how hard he throws the ball and how fast it gets to the plate.</p>
<p>So who has the most control over a team in a sport like soccer? It’s not easy to say because there are so many players on a soccer team. But if I had to choose one player who has the most control, I would say it’s the goalkeeper. He controls who gets to shoot on goal and when to punt or throw out of bounds. He can also help his defense by coming out of goal to play balls that are headed for his net.</p>
