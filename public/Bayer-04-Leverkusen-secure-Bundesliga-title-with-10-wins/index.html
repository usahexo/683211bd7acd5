        <h1 id="Bayer-04-Leverkusen-secure-Bundesliga-title-with-10-wins"><a href="#Bayer-04-Leverkusen-secure-Bundesliga-title-with-10-wins" class="headerlink" title="Bayer 04 Leverkusen secure Bundesliga title with 10 wins"></a>Bayer 04 Leverkusen secure Bundesliga title with 10 wins</h1><p>A magnificent 10th consecutive Bundesliga victory – the fourth in a row under Heiko Herrlich – clinched the championship trophy for Bayer 04 Leverkusen on Matchday 33.</p>
<p>“It’s an amazing feeling to have won the title. The boys deserve it after all the hard work they’ve put in,” enthused captain Lars Bender.</p>
<p>The champagne was on ice from the moment Bayern München were held to a goalless draw by SC Freiburg, but for fortuitous Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernandez goals in either half against Werder Bremen at the BayArena, some nervy moments would have been required.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was a thoroughly deserved and well-deserved title success for last season’s runners-up. They became only the fourth club in Bundesliga history – and first since FC Bayern in 2012/13 – to win 10 successive fixtures at this stage of the season and also set a new club record with 27 wins in 34 matches.</p>
<p>Herrlich has clearly injected new impetus into the side following their agonising near-miss last term, but there is no doubt that key players such as goalkeeper Bernd Leno, winger Leon Bailey and experienced midfielders Bender and Kevin Kampl have all played their part too.</p>
<h1 id="10-proves-to-be-lucky-number-for-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-in-Champions-League"><a href="#10-proves-to-be-lucky-number-for-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-in-Champions-League" class="headerlink" title="10 proves to be lucky number for Bayer 04 Leverkusen in Champions League"></a>10 proves to be lucky number for Bayer 04 Leverkusen in Champions League</h1><p>Ahead of their clash against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, Bayer 04 Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt was confident of his side’s chances. He believed that the number 10 – which has been lucky for the club in recent years – would bring them success once again.</p>
<p>The first game of the knockout stages did not disappoint, as Bayer recorded a comfortable 3-0 victory over Diego Simeone’s Atletico. Javier Hernandez got the scoring underway early on before Admir Mehmedi and Hakan Calhanoglu doubled the advantage in the second half.</p>
<p>It was an excellent performance from the Bundesliga side, who played some scintillating football at the BayArena. They now travel to Madrid for the second leg with a healthy lead, and there is every chance they could reach the quarter-finals of Europe’s elite competition.</p>
<p>Atletico have been one of Europe’s most consistent sides in recent years, reaching at least the semi-finals of the Champions League in each of the last four seasons. However, they were no match for Bayer 04 Leverkusen on Tuesday night, and it is likely to be a different story at the Vicente Calderon next week.</p>
<p>Roger Schmidt will be without captain Lars Bender through suspension, but excellent displays from Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi in his absence suggest that Bayer will not miss him too much. With Hernandez also in superb form, Atletico are sure to find it tough next week as they look to overturn a three-goal deficit.</p>
<h1 id="10-0-demolition-of-Werder-Bremen-biggest-win-in-club’s-history"><a href="#10-0-demolition-of-Werder-Bremen-biggest-win-in-club’s-history" class="headerlink" title="10-0 demolition of Werder Bremen biggest win in club’s history"></a>10-0 demolition of Werder Bremen biggest win in club’s history</h1><p>Wolfsburg’s stunning 10-0 demolition of Werder Bremen was the biggest win in the club’s history, and it was thoroughly deserved.</p>
<p>The Wolves were outstanding from start to finish, and they could have easily scored more than 10 goals if they had been a bit more clinical in front of goal.</p>
<p>Bremen were completely outplayed by Wolfsburg, and they never looked like posing a threat to the home side’s goal.</p>
<p>Dieter Hecking’s men were absolutely fantastic, and they thoroughly deserved all three points on Sunday.</p>
<p>Here are some of the Wolfsburg players who stood out against Werder Bremen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Max Kruse - The Wolfsburg striker was in sensational form against Bremen, scoring four goals and creating several other chances. He was a constant menace to the Bremen defence, and he fully deserved his Man of the Match award.</li>
<li>Ivan Perisic - The Croatian winger was also in superb form against Werder Bremen, scoring two goals and creating several chances for his teammates. He was one of Wolfsburg’s most dangerous players throughout the match, and he fully deserves his place in this team of the week.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Bayern-Munich-pip-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-to-the-Bundesliga-title-on-dramatic-final-day"><a href="#Bayern-Munich-pip-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-to-the-Bundesliga-title-on-dramatic-final-day" class="headerlink" title="Bayern Munich pip Bayer 04 Leverkusen to the Bundesliga title on dramatic final day"></a>Bayern Munich pip Bayer 04 Leverkusen to the Bundesliga title on dramatic final day</h1><p>The Bundesliga title race went down to the wire on the final day of the season, with Bayern Munich just pip Bayer 04 Leverkusen to the championship.</p>
<p>It was tight all the way, with both teams neck and neck for much of the season. But it was Bayern who eventually came out on top, winning their 26th Bundesliga title in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>With only minutes remaining in the season, it looked as though Bayer would snatch the title away from Bayern. They were leading 3-2 and appeared to be on course for victory.</p>
<p>But then Bayern staged a late comeback, scoring a goal in injury time to equalise and send the title race into extra time.</p>
<p>There was no further scoring in extra time, so the championship would be decided by a penalty shootout. And it was Bayern who prevailed, winning 5-4 on penalties to clinch their 26th Bundesliga title.</p>
<p>It was an incredible end to an incredible season, and Bayern can now celebrate being crowned Bundesliga champions once again.</p>
<h1 id="Bayer-04-Leverkusen-finish-runners-up-in-Champions-League-after-narrow-defeat-to-Barcelona"><a href="#Bayer-04-Leverkusen-finish-runners-up-in-Champions-League-after-narrow-defeat-to-Barcelona" class="headerlink" title="Bayer 04 Leverkusen finish runners-up in Champions League after narrow defeat to Barcelona"></a>Bayer 04 Leverkusen finish runners-up in Champions League after narrow defeat to Barcelona</h1><p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen battled valiantly against Barcelona but were eventually undone by a Lionel Messi goal in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final. The Catalan side progress to the final 3-2 on aggregate, but it was a close tie with Leverkusen going down fighting.</p>
<p>manager Roger Schmidt will be proud of his side’s performance, as they took the game to the Spanish giants and created some good chances. However, they were undone by a moment of magic from Messi who scored in the 75th minute after a lovely through ball from Andres Iniesta.</p>
<p>Despite the defeat, Leverkusen can take heart from their excellent season which has seen them reach the last four of Europe’s top club competition for the first time in their history. They will now focus on trying to win the Bundesliga title, which they narrowly missed out on this year, and hope to go even further in next year’s Champions League.</p>
