Regardless of where one stands on the issue, there is little doubt that gambling can be big business. In fact, according to the American Gaming Association, in 2017 commercial casinos in the United States brought in $41.2 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Now, it appears as though online gambling may be coming to a state near you. According to recent reports, lawmakers in a number of states are considering legislation that would legalize some form of online gambling. For example, in Pennsylvania lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow residents to gamble online on casino games and sports betting. And in New York, lawmakers are looking at a bill that would allow for both online casino games and sports betting.</p>
<p>So why is this happening now? One reason may be because of the Supreme Court’s decision last year in the case of Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association. In that case, the Court struck down a federal law that barred states from legalizing sports betting. Since then, many states have moved to legalize sports betting, and it seems likely that other forms of gambling will soon follow suit.</p>
<p>Another reason for the growth of online gambling may be the increasing popularity of esports. As more people watch events like the League of Legends World Championship or the Overwatch League Finals, the potential for gambling on those events grows as well. In fact, there are already a number of websites where people can bet on esports matches.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? Well, if you’re living in one of the states where online gambling is being considered, it may soon be legal to gamble online. And if you’re interested in betting on esports matches, there are already a number of websites where you can do so. Be sure to check out our list of recommended sites below!</p>

<h1 id="Trump-says-he’ll-legalize-online-gambling-if-elected"><a href="#Trump-says-he’ll-legalize-online-gambling-if-elected" class="headerlink" title="Trump says he’ll legalize online gambling if elected"></a>Trump says he’ll legalize online gambling if elected</h1><p>In what could be seen as a surprising announcement, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said that he will legalize online gambling if elected to the White House.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said that he wants to see online gambling legalized because it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to states.</p>
<p>“I am in favor of it,” Trump said. “I know people that are making a fortune on it right now, and I think it’s something we should open up.”</p>
<p>The real estate mogul also criticized his rivals for not being more supportive of legalizing online gambling. Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have all expressed opposition to legalizing internet gambling, but Trump says that they are “ missing out on a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Trump’s comments come at a time when the future of online gambling is uncertain. In October last year, the Department of Justice issued a new opinion which effectively re-opened the door for states to legalize online gambling. However, many lawmakers are still hesitant to support legalization due to concerns about addiction and crime.</p>
<p>So far, only three states have legalized online gambling: New Jersey, Delaware and Nevada. If Trump is elected president, it’s likely that many more states will follow suit.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Trump-make-online-gambling-legal-in-the-USA"><a href="#Will-Trump-make-online-gambling-legal-in-the-USA" class="headerlink" title="Will Trump make online gambling legal in the USA?"></a>Will Trump make online gambling legal in the USA?</h1><p>The United States has a complicated gambling history. Gambling was first mentioned in the Constitution, but it was not until 1931 that the first federal law specifically addressing gambling was enacted. Since then, there have been numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to gambling.</p>
<p>Gambling is currently legal in Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. In addition, several other states have legalized some form of online gambling. Online gambling is illegal in most states, with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>There has been talk of legalizing online gambling at the federal level for many years. However, there has been little action on this front under the Trump administration. In March 2018, Congressman Frank Pallone introduced a bill that would legalize online gambling at the federal level. This bill has yet to be voted on by the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Some stakeholders are in favor of legalizing online gambling, while others are opposed to it. Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble, and that it would generate tax revenue for states and the federal government. opponents argue that it is addictive and could lead to financial ruin for consumers.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether or not Trump will support legalizing online gambling at the federal level. His position on this issue has not been announced publicly.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-industry-bullish-on-Trump’s-pledge-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Gambling-industry-bullish-on-Trump’s-pledge-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling industry bullish on Trump’s pledge to legalize online gambling"></a>Gambling industry bullish on Trump’s pledge to legalize online gambling</h1><p>Online gambling could be legalized in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, according to some in the industry who believe his expansive business background means he’ll be more open to letting states legalize and regulate the activity.</p>
<p>“He’s a businessman,” said Alan Mutter, a media consultant and former newspaper editor who has studied the gambling industry. “He understands that there is money to be made.”</p>
<p>Commercial gaming companies such as Las Vegas Sands Corp., Wynn Resorts Ltd. and MGM Resorts International have already expressed interest in entering the online gambling market if it is legalized.</p>
<p>In addition to his casinos, Trump also has other business ventures that could benefit from online gambling legalization, such as his new hotel in Washington D.C., which is near Maryland, one of the few states where online gambling is currently legal.</p>
<p>“I don’t see any reason why he wouldn’t be supportive of it,” said Jason Ader, a casino analyst at Wall Street firm Nomura Holdings Inc.<br>IIn September, Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy introduced a bill that would allow states to legalize internet poker and other forms of online gambling within their borders. The bill has yet to be voted on, but McCarthy said he plans to bring it up for a vote early next year.</p>
<p>Trump has not taken a public stance on the issue of online gambling, but in February he voiced support for restoring state’s rights on the matter.<br>“I’m OK with it because it’s happening anyway,” Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas. “But they should really have authority because it’s happening anyway.”</p>
<h1 id="What-will-it-take-for-Trump-to-legalize-online-gambling-in-the-USA"><a href="#What-will-it-take-for-Trump-to-legalize-online-gambling-in-the-USA" class="headerlink" title="What will it take for Trump to legalize online gambling in the USA?"></a>What will it take for Trump to legalize online gambling in the USA?</h1><p>Only time will tell what it will take for Trump to legalize online gambling in the USA; however, there are several contributing factors that could lead to this long overdue change.</p>
<p>For starters, Trump has shown himself to be a proponent of business deregulation; in fact, his administration has targeted dozens of Obama-era policies that he feels are detrimental to businesses. Online gambling is certainly no exception, as the industry faces numerous restrictions and regulations that make it difficult to operate. By repealing some of these regulations, Trump could provide a more hospitable environment for online gambling providers and help them flourish.</p>
<p>Secondly, Trump has voiced his support for the restoration of state rights – a cause that is especially popular among Republicans. This could lead him to overturn the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which prohibited financial institutions from processing payments for online gambling transactions. The act was passed under George W. Bush’s administration, and many believe it was done at the behest of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Since then, Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware have all legalized some form of online gambling, but players in other states are still unable to participate. Overturning the UIGEA would give states the authority to decide whether or not to legalize online gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>Lastly, Trump has shown a willingness to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – an important attribute when it comes to legalizing online gambling. In fact, one of the main proponents of legalizing online gambling is Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), who believes it could generate billions in revenue for the government. Schumer has already reached out to Trump about the issue, and we could see them team up on this legislation in the near future.</p>
<p>All things considered, it seems likely that Trump will eventually legalize online gambling in the USA; but when exactly that will happen is anyone’s guess.</p>
