        <h1 id="Grizzlies-back-to-basics-play-with-10-containers"><a href="#Grizzlies-back-to-basics-play-with-10-containers" class="headerlink" title="Grizzlies back to basics: play with 10 containers"></a>Grizzlies back to basics: play with 10 containers</h1><p>After experimenting with different player combinations and offensive schemes throughout the preseason, the Memphis Grizzlies have decided to go back to basics. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff has announced that the team will play with 10 containers on offense, in order to simplify the game for his players.</p>
<p>“We’ve been trying too many things in preseason, and it’s just not working,” Bickerstaff said. “It’s time to go back to what we know best.”</p>
<p>The move is a bit of a surprise, as the Grizzlies were thought to be one of the most improved teams in the league this season. But after scoring only 97 points in their last two games, they’ve decided to make a change.</p>
<p>“We’re not clicking on all cylinders yet,” center Marc Gasol said. “So Coach is trying something new.”</p>
<p>With Mike Conley out due to injury, the Grizzlies may struggle early on with this new offensive scheme. But if they can find a way to make it work, they could be a dangerous team come playoff time.</p>
<h1 id="1-5-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack"><a href="#1-5-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack" class="headerlink" title="1.5 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack"></a>1.5 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack</h1><p>In a previous blog post, we discussed how the Memphis Grizzlies were struggling offensively and how one possible solution was to give more minutes to younger players. The theory was that the lack of spacing on the floor was due to Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph taking up too much space in the paint.</p>
<p>We suggested playing Brandan Wright and JaMychal Green alongside Gasol in order to create more space for Mike Conley and Tony Allen to drive and kick. This would also force defenses to respect the three point shot, which is something that Memphis is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>So far, this has been a failed experiment. The Grizzlies are still scoring at a rate of less than 100 points per game and are now 2-8 over their last 10 games.</p>
<p>There are two main problems with this lineup: 1) Wright and Green cannot create their own shots and 2) there is not enough shooting on the floor. Wright and Green are both good players, but they need someone else on the floor who can create shots for them.</p>
<p>This is where Chandler Parsons comes into play. Parsons is a very good player who can shoot, drive, and pass. He would be a perfect fit next to Wright and Green since he could create shots for them as well as himself.</p>
<p>Additionally, Parsons would add some much needed shooting to the Grizzlies’ offense. He shoots 36% from three point range and would be a major upgrade over Vince Carter or James Ennis III.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle for the Grizzlies is his contract. Parsons is owed almost $24 million this season and next season. However, if they can amnesty Tony Allen, they would have enough money to sign Parsons outright.</p>
<p>It’s time for the Grizzlies to abandon their traditional lineup of Gasol and Randolph and try something new. Playing Wright, Green, and Parsons together would be a much better solution for their offense woes.</p>
<h1 id="2-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack"><a href="#2-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack" class="headerlink" title="2 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack"></a>2 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack</h1><p>The Memphis Grizzlies are back in the playoff mix, thanks in part to their resurgence over the past few weeks. However, Mike Conley’s injury could be a dagger in their postseason hopes.</p>
<p>Yes, at full strength the Grizzlies have two quality starting centers in Marc Gasol and JaMychal Green. But with Conley sidelined for what is expected to be an extended period of time,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> can Memphis really afford to keep both big men on the floor?</p>
<p>Injuries happen, and every team has to deal with them at some point or another. But not having your best player available is a major blow, especially this deep into the season.</p>
<p>Conley is by far Memphis’ most important player. He averages nearly 20 points and six assists per game while also being one of the better defenders at his position. His ability to score in a variety of ways makes him difficult to stop, as does his size (6’1″).</p>
<p>Without Conley, defenses will key in on Gasol and Green even more than they already do. That could lead to some mismatches that the Grizzlies may not be able to take advantage of.</p>
<p> smaller teams like Minnesota and Denver have done well against Memphis this season by playing three-guard lineups and spreading the floor. With Conley out, those type of lineups become even more dangerous for the Grizzlies.</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly how much time Conley will miss, but it’s unlikely he returns anytime soon. In the meantime, Coach David Fizdale will have to come up with creative ways to keep his team afloat without its best player.</p>
<h1 id="3-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack"><a href="#3-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack" class="headerlink" title="3 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack"></a>3 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack</h1><p>There are three containers in a black jack game. Each container has chips of different colors. Initially, there are 100 red chips, 100 yellow chips, and 100 blue chips in the game.</p>
<p>The player can take any action allowed by the game. The player can:</p>
<p>-Take all the chips in one container.<br>-Take any number of chips from one or more containers.<br>-Place a chip from one container into another container.</p>
<p>If the player has no chips left in a particular container, then that container’s chips are removed from the game.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to have as many chips as possible at the end of the game.</p>
<h1 id="4-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack"><a href="#4-containers-not-enough-for-Grizzlies-in-black-jack" class="headerlink" title="4 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack"></a>4 containers not enough for Grizzlies in black jack</h1><p>The Memphis Grizzlies are in the market for an upgrade at center and they have identified Andre Drummond as their top target.</p>
<p>NBA front-office sources told ESPN that the Grizzlies have had exploratory discussions with the Detroit Pistons about a trade for Drummond.</p>
<p>But Memphis is reluctant to give up too much for a player who is set to become a free agent after next season and whose long-term future with the Pistons is uncertain.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies would want to include at least one young player and one future first-round pick in any deal for Drummond, sources said.</p>
<p>Memphis currently has four players who can play center – Marc Gasol, JaMychal Green, Kyle Anderson and Bruno Caboclo – which could make them reluctant to give up too much for Drummond.</p>
<p>The Pistons would want at least two of those players in return for Drummond, according to ESPN’s Zach Lowe.</p>
<p>Drummond averaged 16.8 points and an NBA-best 15.0 rebounds last season. He will make $25 million this season and has a player option worth $28 million for 2020-21.</p>
