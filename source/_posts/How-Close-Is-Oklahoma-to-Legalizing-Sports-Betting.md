#  How Close Is Oklahoma to Legalizing Sports Betting?

In May 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had effectively prohibited sports betting in most states. The decision paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

Since the ruling, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Mississippi. Oklahoma is one of several states that are considering legalizing sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court decision.

So far, there has been no movement in the Oklahoma legislature to legalize sports betting. However, earlier this year, a study commissioned by the state gaming commission recommended that Oklahoma legalize and regulate sports betting.

The commission's report found that legalized sports betting could generate up to $149 million in annual revenue for the state. The report also found that there is strong public support for legalized sports betting in Oklahoma.

Many people view legalized sports betting as a way to help boost the state's economy. Others see it as a way to generate new revenue for education and other important programs.

So far, there has been no word on when or if the Oklahoma legislature will take up the issue of legalizing sports betting. However, with several other states moving quickly to legalize sports betting, it is likely only a matter of time before Oklahoma does as well.

#  Golden State Warriors Could Legalize Sports Betting In California

The Golden State Warriors may have just found a way to legalize sports betting in California.

On Wednesday, the Warriors filed paperwork with the state government indicating their intention to create a new company, Golden State Sports Ventures (GSSV). The proposed company would own and operate a sports and entertainment complex in downtown San Francisco.

While the primary purpose of the GSSV is to build the new complex, the filing also contains a number of intriguing details about the company’s plans for legalized sports betting in California. For example, GSSV has proposed that it be designated as the official operator of sports betting in the state.

Assuming that GSSV is successful in its application, this would give it a major advantage over other potential operators of sports betting in California. Not only would GSSV have exclusive rights to run sports betting operations at its complex, but it would also be able to offer these services statewide.

This would be a major coup for the Warriors, as it would allow them to tap into what is expected to be a very lucrative market. In 2017, Americans bet over $150 billion on sports, and that figure is only expected to grow in coming years.

The Warriors are not the only team eyeing a piece of the sports betting pie. In May, the NBA submitted a proposal to Congress calling for nationwide legalization of sports betting. The league has long been supportive of gambling on its games, and sees legal sports betting as an opportunity to increase revenues.

Other leagues, including MLB and the NFL, have also expressed support for legalizing sports betting. This widespread backing suggests that we are likely to see legalized sports betting in some form in the near future.

#  How Close Is New Jersey To Legalizing Sports Betting?

On Monday, May 14th, the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that limited sports betting to just four states. The law in question, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, was widely seen as outdated and effectively outlawed sports betting everywhere except Nevada, Delaware, Montana, and Oregon.

Immediately after the Supreme Court’s ruling was announced, several states indicated an interest in legalizing sports betting within their borders. These include New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi. Of this group, New Jersey is by far the closest to actually implementing a sports betting program; in fact, they may even have something up and running before the end of the year.

The Garden State has been attempting to legalize sports betting for years now. Their latest attempt came in the form of a bill passed by the state legislature in February 2018. The bill allowed for sports betting at casinos and racetracks in New Jersey, but it was subject to a veto by then-Governor Chris Christie. Christie ultimately vetoed the bill because he felt that it did not give enough power to New Jersey’s gaming regulators.

In May 2018, however, Christie was replaced as Governor by Phil Murphy. Murphy is a strong supporter of legalized sports betting and has already said that he will sign the February 2018 bill into law. This means that New Jersey could have a sports betting program up and running within months of the Supreme Court’s ruling; all they need now is an official go-ahead from Murphy.

Given how close New Jersey is to legalizing sports betting, it’s likely that other states will soon follow suit. It’s also possible that Congress will take action to regulate sports betting on a national level; after all, there are plenty of tax dollars to be made from this industry. No matter what happens next, it’s clear that the legalization of sports gambling is coming – it’s just a question of when.

#  Is It Time to Legalize Sports Betting in the US?

The Supreme Court recently heard a case that could legalize sports betting across the United States. The case, Christie v. NCAA, centers around the question of whether or not the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) violates the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution.

PASPA prohibits most states from legalizing and regulating sports betting. New Jersey is challenging PASPA, arguing that it infringes on state sovereignty. The state of New Jersey claims that it should be able to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting within its borders.

The plaintiffs in Christie v. NCAA include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the state's horse racing industry, and several citizens of New Jersey. They argue that PASPA is unconstitutional because it forces states to maintain outdated laws that are no longer in the best interests of their citizens.

The defendants in this case are the NCAA, which opposes any legalization of sports betting, and the United States government, which defends PASPA as a valid exercise of Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in this case by June 2018. If it rules in favor of New Jersey, it will open the door for other states to legalize sports betting. This would likely be a boon for casino operators and other businesses that could benefit from increased tourism and gambling revenue.

However, some opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling and other social ills. They also warn that organized crime could gain a foothold in the US sports betting market if it is legalized.

So far, only a handful of states have moved to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court's decision to hear Christie v. NCAA. Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have all passed laws allowing some form of sports betting within their borders.

#  Many States Are Inching Closer To Legalizing Sports Betting, But Will Golden State Warriors Be The First?

On Monday, the US Supreme Court overturned a law that prohibited gambling on college and professional sports in most states. The decision opens the door for states to legalize sports betting.

Since the decision, several states have already expressed interest in legalizing sports betting. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have all introduced legislation to allow sports betting within their borders.

Nevada is the only state currently allowed to offer full-scale sports betting. However, many of Nevada's largest casinos are already preparing to expand their sports betting operations to include more states.

Despite the movement towards legalizing sports betting, it's still unclear if the Golden State Warriors will be the first team to offer legal sports betting. The NBA has been mostly silent on the issue and has not taken a public stance on legalizing sports betting.

One major concern for the league is how to protect the integrity of its games. Sports leagues have long argued that gambling could lead to game-fixing and other forms of cheating.

However, many proponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will create more transparency and accountability in the gambling industry. And since fans are already illegally gambling on games, it's likely that any form of regulation would be an improvement over the current situation.

It remains to be seen whether or not other teams will follow in the Warriors' footsteps if they become the first team to legalize sports betting. But given the recent Supreme Court decision, it's likely that more states will move towards legalizing this form of gambling in the near future.
