#  What inspired the game's design?

When developing Cuphead, we were inspired by classic 1930s cartoons. We wanted to capture that vintage look and feel, while also incorporating our own unique style.

A big part of that was creating an interesting and challenging boss fight experience. We wanted players to feel like they were really testing their skills against these powerful creatures.

To achieve this, we developed a unique boss battle mechanics system that allows for a high degree of flexibility and creativity. This ensures that each boss is different and provides a fresh challenge for players.

One way for a player to win is by having the best hand at the end of the hand. This can be done by playing the best cards that they have, or by bluffing their opponents into folding. If a player can get all of their opponents to fold, then they will automatically win the hand.
