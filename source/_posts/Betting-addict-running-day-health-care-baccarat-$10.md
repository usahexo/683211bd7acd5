#  Betting addict running day health care baccarat $10

This morning, I woke up early to go running. I like to get a good sweat going before I start my day. My body feels more energized and alert. As I was getting dressed, I couldn’t help but think about the $10 I had staked on last night’s baccarat game.

I was up against some pretty tough competition at the casino last night, but I was determined to win back my losses from the previous night. I had gone all in on my final bet and lost, resulting in a $10 loss.

I know that I should never gamble with money that I can’t afford to lose, but it’s hard to resist the lure of gambling when the stakes are high. I can’t help but feel a sense of excitement when the cards are being dealt and the adrenaline starts pumping.

Even though I lost last night, I still enjoyed playing baccarat. It’s such a thrilling game to play and there’s always so much tension surrounding each hand.

I definitely don’t want to become a full-blown gambling addict, but there’s something about this game that keeps drawing me back. Perhaps it’s the rush of winning or the thrill of gambling on a risky bet.

No matter what the reason is, I need to be careful not to let gambling take over my life. If I keep betting money that I can’t afford to lose, then eventually I will go bankrupt. And that is definitely not something that I want to happen.

#  Betting addict's $10 gamble could ruin health care facility

Imagine if a $10 bet by a gambling addict affected the health care of an entire hospital. It's a scary thought, but that's what could happen if the state doesn't address the issue soon.

Gambling addicts account for about one-third of all casino losses, and their impacts on businesses can be devastating. Nowhere is that more evident than in the health care industry, where addicted gamblers have been known to place enormous bets that can ultimately lead to the closure of hospitals or other medical facilities.

In order to protect the health of thousands of patients, as well as preserve jobs in the health care industry, state lawmakers must take swift action to address this growing problem. One proposal would require those who place large bets at casinos to sign a waiver indicating they are not doing so on behalf of a healthcare facility.

This would help deter gambling addicts from placing bets that could potentially harm the health of an organization. It would also provide greater transparency and accountability for those who make such bets, and could prevent taxpayer money from being used to cover any losses incurred by healthcare facilities.

While no one solution will solve the problem of gambling addiction, this measure is a common-sense step that can help safeguard our health care system from these harmful impacts. Lawmakers should pass it without delay.

#  Baccarat addiction risks health care funding 

There is a growing concern over the addiction of baccarat, which is eating into Hong Kong's health care budget.
To date, HK$1.8 billion has been lost to baccarat addiction in the past two years, according to a study by the University of Hong Kong released on Wednesday.

"Baccarat is a very addictive game," said Dr Gabriel Lau Gi-shing, who led the study. "It's easy to lose track of time and money while playing."

The study found that 55 percent of people who gamble at the city's casinos are hooked on baccarat. They account for 92 percent of total gambling losses at the casinos.

The problem is exacerbated by Macau's recent liberalization of casino gaming, which has seen an influx of players from mainland China keen to gamble in the territory.

Given that most Gamble Responsibly (formerly known as Gamblers Anonymous) meetings are held in English, it can be difficult for Cantonese speakers to access help, according to Chan Ki-lap, vice-chairman of the Democratic Party's gambling policy panel.

Budget constraints also limit how much help government can provide addicts, he added. The Social Welfare Department offers rehabilitation services for up to six months at a cost of HK$100,000 per person, but there are waiting lists for both local and Mainland Chinese residents.

#  Day health care facility risks closure over baccarat addict

[Kim Yoo-jin, a day health care worker, says she may have to close down her day health care facility because one of her patients, a baccarat addict, has not paid her debts.]

Since opening my day health care facility seven years ago, I have never had to face such a difficult decision as whether to close it down or not. But that is the dilemma I am currently facing because one of my patients, a baccarat addict, has not paid me back the debt he owes me.

The patient in question is a 55-year-old man who has been gambling at the casino for the past two years. He started borrowing money from me about six months ago in order to cover his gambling losses. I lent him a total of 10 million won (US$8,900), but he has only repaid 2 million won so far. The man recently stopped coming to my day health care facility and stopped repaying his debt altogether. This means that I am now at risk of losing the entire 10 million won that I lent him.

I originally considered simply writing off the debt as bad debt and moving on. But after giving it some more thought, I have decided that this is not an option. Losing 10 million won would be a huge blow to my business, and it would be very difficult for me to repay that amount of money. So I have no choice but to consider closing down my day health care facility if the man does not pay me back soon.

This situation is yet another example of how casinos can cause serious financial harm to ordinary people. Baccarat is a very risky game and it can quickly lead people into debt. This man is now in danger of losing his home and his business because of his gambling addiction. The casinos should be held responsible for the damage they cause to people's lives.

#  Betting addict jeopardizes health care for others

There is an alarming trend of people who are putting their gambling addictions ahead of their health and the health of others. This has resulted in increased wait times and shortages for those requiring medical care.

The staff at the local hospital are scrambling to keep up with the demand for services, while also caring for patients with other life-threatening conditions. The emergency room is often packed with people who have been harmed by someone else’s addiction.

In one case, a man was brought into the ER after having a heart attack due to stress from his gambling addiction. His wife had to wait for hours before she could be seen by a doctor.

Many hospitals are now limiting the number of non-emergency procedures they perform in order to make more room for patients with urgent needs. This means that people with less serious conditions may have to travel farther or wait longer for treatment.

It is heartbreaking to see innocent people suffer because of someone else’s actions. Gambling addicts need our help and support, not condemnation. We must find a way to get them the assistance they need before it’s too late.
