# Blackjack: When to Hit in a 2-Deck Game - Insights from Flaubert

Gustave Flaubert was a famous French novelist who lived during the 19th century. Although he did not have direct insights on the game of blackjack, his emphasis on observation and critical thinking can be applied to the decision of when to hit in a 2-deck game. In this article, we will explore some key strategies and insights from Flaubert on when to hit in a 2-deck game of blackjack.

## The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a popular casino card game that is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The objective of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21, which is called "busting."

Each card in the deck is assigned a point value, with numbered cards being worth their face value, face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) being worth 10 points each, and aces being worth either one or 11 points, depending on which value is more favorable for the player.

## When to Hit in a 2-Deck Game

A 2-deck game of blackjack is played with two decks of standard playing cards, and has slightly different odds and strategies than a single-deck game. Here are some key strategies and insights from Flaubert on when to hit in a 2-deck game of blackjack:

1. Hit when your hand value is less than 12, as you are at a high risk of busting if you don't.
2. Hit when you have a soft hand (an ace and another card that adds up to less than 10) and the dealer's face-up card is less than your hand value.
3. Hit when you have a hand value of 12 to 16 and the dealer's face-up card is a 7 or higher, as you are at a high risk of losing if you don't.
4. Stand when your hand value is 17 or higher, as you have a good chance of winning with your current hand.

It is important to note that the decision of when to hit in a 2-deck game of blackjack depends on various factors, such as the specific rules of the game, the cards in play, and your own intuition and risk tolerance. Therefore, it is important to observe the game and use critical thinking to make the best decision for your own hand.

## Conclusion

Knowing when to hit in a 2-deck game of blackjack requires a combination of observation, critical thinking, and risk management. By following key strategies and insights from Flaubert on when to hit in a 2-deck game of blackjack, you can increase your chances of winning and make more informed decisions about your bets. However, it is important to consider the specific rules of the game and use your own intuition and risk tolerance to make the best decision for your own hand. With insights from Flaubert, you can take your blackjack skills to the next level and feel more confident at the table.
