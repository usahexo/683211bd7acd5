#  Federal Prosecutors Charge Dozens in Connection with $32 Million Illegal Gambling Ring

On Wednesday, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York announced charges against 36 people in connection with an illegal gambling ring that took in more than $32 million in wagers.

The defendants are accused of operating two gambling websites — one based in Costa Rica and the other in Canada — that accepted bets on a variety of sporting events, including professional and college football, basketball, and baseball games.

According to the indictment, the defendants used offshore bank accounts to process payments from players and then paid out winnings using wire transfers and cryptocurrency.

Prosecutors say that the defendants also employed a bookmaker who traveled between New York and Costa Rica to take in and payout bets. The bookmaker is said to have made more than $1 million in commissions for his role in the scheme.

“As alleged, these defendants concocted an elaborate slush fund by running an illegal internet gambling operation that took millions of dollars in bets on sports games,”said Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “In order to conceal their criminal enterprise, they went to great lengths to avoid paying taxes on their ill-gotten gains and misled banking institutions about the true nature of their business.”

The indictment charges all 36 defendants with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud. Several of the defendants are also charged with tax evasion and other offenses.

If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison for the money laundering conspiracy charge and up to 30 years for each wire fraud charge.

#  NJ Woman Pleads Guilty to Illegally Running Gambling Operation

A 37-year-old woman from New Jersey has pleaded guilty to illegally running a gambling operation. The woman was arrested in May 2017 after it was discovered that she had been operating an illegal gambling business out of her home.

According to prosecutors, the woman had been accepting bets on sporting events and other activities online and via text messages. She is said to have made over $200,000 in profits from the operation.

The woman has now pleaded guilty to one count of promoting gambling and one count of money laundering. She faces up to five years in prison on each charge.

Prosecutors say that this is the first time someone has been convicted of promoting gambling in New Jersey using a cell phone. They are warning others that they can also be prosecuted for engaging in similar activities.

#  Illegal Gambling Ring Busted in Tennessee

On Tuesday, January 10th, 2017, police in Tennessee executed a search warrant on a property suspected of being involved in an illegal gambling ring. The raid resulted in the seizure of 18 computers, $8,000 cash, and several betting slips.

The police investigation began in late 2016 after reports of suspicious activity at the property. Detectives believe that the site was being used to illegally gamble on sporting events. The seized computers are being examined for evidence of gambling-related crimes.

This is not the first time that police have busted an illegal gambling ring in Tennessee. In late 2015, authorities shut down a similar operation which was thought to have generated over $1 million in illegal profits.

Gambling is a popular pastime all over the United States, but it is also a crime in many states. In Tennessee, both gambling and operating a gambling business without a license are Class C misdemeanors. Those convicted can face up to 6 months in jail and a $500 fine.

#  14 People Indicted in Alleged Illegal Gambling Operation

The Department of Justice announced on Thursday that 14 people had been indicted in connection with an alleged illegal gambling operation.

The defendants, who include the alleged ringleader, are all charged with conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business and money laundering.

According to prosecutors, the gambling ring was operational for at least two years and took in more than $10 million in bets.

Among the allegations made against the defendants is that they knowingly accepted bets from minors and that they used offshore websites to take wagers.

"This indictment alleges a sprawling international conspiracy that crossed numerous state lines and oceans," said U.S. Attorney John Horn in a statement. "The defendants routinely took sports bets from gamblers in the US, but also solicited bets from around the world."

If convicted, the defendants could face up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy charge and up to 10 years for money laundering.

#  Police Raid Illegal Gambling Den in Brooklyn

Wednesday night, the NYPD conducted a raid on an illegal gambling den in Brooklyn.

The raid was part of a larger operation led by the department’s Gaming Enforcement Unit, which is tasked with shutting down illegal gambling operations throughout the city.

According to police, the gambling den was located in an apartment in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. Officers seized approximately $10,000 in cash and several gaming devices during the raid.

No arrests were made, but authorities say they are still investigating the matter and that further arrests are likely.

This is just the latest in a string of raids conducted by the NYPD Gaming Enforcement Unit. In recent months, the unit has shut down several other illegal gambling operations, including one in Chinatown and another in Queens.

Illegal gambling is a problem that has been growing in New York City in recent years. There are now estimated to be hundreds of illegal gambling operations throughout the city, and they are responsible for millions of dollars in lost tax revenue every year.

The NYPD Gaming Enforcement Unit is doing important work in combating this problem, and I applaud them for their efforts. I hope that they will continue to crack down on these illegal operations, and that they will ultimately be successful in shutting them all down.
