#  Pathological Gambling Could be Considered Illegal Gambling Under New Bill

Pathological gambling is a problem gambler who can’t control their gaming habits, even when it leads to negative consequences in their life. The new bill introduced by senator Lindsey Graham would make pathological gambling illegal, which would likely have a significant impact on those suffering from the disorder.

Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem, with an estimated 2 million Americans suffering from pathological gambling. This bill would provide much-needed help for those individuals and their families.

Pathological gambling can have devastating consequences, including job loss, financial instability, and damage to relationships. Individuals with the disorder often try to hide their problem from friends and family, leading to even more isolation and shame.

Making pathological gambling illegal will provide much-needed resources for those affected by the disorder. It will also help raise awareness about this serious issue. If you or someone you know suffers from pathological gambling, please seek help. There is hope and healing available.

#  Internet Gambling Could be Considered Illegal Gambling Under New Bill

There is a new bill being proposed in the United States Congress that could make it illegal for anyone to engage in internet gambling. The bill, which is known as the "Restoration of America's Wire Act," or RAWA, was introduced by Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) on March 4th.

If the bill passes, it would be placed in the Illegal Gambling Business Act, which would make it a crime to "conduct or participate" in any form of internet gambling. This would include not just online casinos and poker rooms, but also lotteries and sports betting.

The Restoration of America's Wire Act was first introduced in 2014, but it failed to gain any traction at that time. However, with Chaffetz now as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, there is a good chance that the bill could pass this time around.

This has caused a great deal of concern among those who work in and benefit from the online gambling industry. They believe that passage of RAWA would be a major blow to their businesses and could even lead to their closure.

Online gambling has been growing rapidly in recent years, and it is now estimated to be worth about $41 billion per year. This makes it an attractive target for lawmakers looking to raise money for the government. Chaffetz himself has admitted that the main motivation behind RAWA is to help generate more revenue for the government.

Those who oppose RAWA argue that it is unnecessary and that existing laws are already sufficient to deal with any potential problems related to internet gambling. They also point out that the proposed bill would hurt many small businesses while doing nothing to combat actual crime syndicates and terrorist financing operations.
