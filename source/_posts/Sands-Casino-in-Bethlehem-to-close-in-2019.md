#  Sands Casino in Bethlehem to close in 2019

The Sands Casino in Bethlehem will be closing its doors in 2019, according to owner and CEO Sheldon Adelson.

The casino has been in operation since 2009 and employs around 2,000 people. It is one of the smaller casinos in Pennsylvania, with just over 200,000 square feet of gaming space.

Adelson said that the decision to close the casino was based on "market conditions." He also said that he is committed to the workers at the casino and that they will be offered jobs at other Adelson properties.

The news comes as a surprise to many in the area, as the Sands Casino was one of the more successful gaming venues in Pennsylvania. It is unclear what will happen to the property once it closes.

The Sands Casino closure is just another step in a larger trend of declining casino revenue in Pennsylvania. In 2017, casino revenue statewide was down 6% from the previous year. This is largely due to increasing competition from states like New York and Maryland, which have recently legalized online gambling.

#  EuroCasino to close its Bethlehem location

After less than a year of operation, EuroCasino has announced that it will be closing its Bethlehem location. This is the latest in a series of closures for the casino, which has seen locations close in Erie, Scranton, and Wilkes-Barre in the past six months.

In a statement released Wednesday, EuroCasino said that the decision to close its Bethlehem location was based on "economic reasons." The company did not provide any further details.

EuroCasino first announced its plans to open a location in Bethlehem last year. At the time, company officials said that the Bethlehem casino would be one of the largest in Pennsylvania. The casino employed 100 people and offered more than 1,000 slot machines and other gaming options.

Local officials expressed disappointment with the news of the closure. "This is very bad news for Bethlehem," said Mayor Robert Donchez. "The casino was an important part of our downtown revitalization effort and it will be missed."

Donchez added that he hopes that another company will step in to fill the void left by EuroCasino's departure.

#  Sands Casino in Bethlehem to shut down by the end of the year

The Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania will shut down by the end of the year, according to a report from ''The Morning Call''.

The closure of the casino, which employs around 2,000 people, is reportedly the result of a dispute between the company that owns the casino - Las Vegas Sands - and its local partner, Wind Creek Hospitality.

Las Vegas Sands has cited financial reasons for the shutdown, but Wind Creek Hospitality says that it offered to keep the casino running but was rebuffed.

A spokesperson for Wind Creek Hospitality told ''The Morning Call'' that the company was "surprised and disappointed" by the closure.

This is just the latest in a series of blows to the Lehigh Valley's gaming industry. The Hollywood Casino in nearby Easton closed its doors last year, leaving just one casino remaining in the region.

#  Sands Casino Bethleham to Close its Doors in January 2019

The Sands Casino Bethlehem, Pennsylvania will be closing its doors in January 2019. The casino will be the fourth largest in the state to close in the past year. The closures are a result of increasing competition from casinos in New York and Maryland.

The Sands Casino Bethlehem opened in 2009 and employs around 1,700 people. It features a hotel, a shopping mall, and a movie theater.

#  End of the line for Sands Casino in Bethlehem

The Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is closing down after a decade of operation. The casino issued a statement on Tuesday announcing the closure, which is effective immediately.

The Sands Casino Resort first opened its doors in 2007. At the time, it was one of the largest casinos in the state, with over 100,000 square feet of gaming space. It featured 2,600 slot machines and 136 table games.

But over the past decade, the casino has seen its market share steadily decline. In 2017, it generated $198 million in gross gaming revenue, down from $236 million in 2009.

"This was a difficult decision but it is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders," said Bob DeSalvio, president of Sands Bethlehem. "We would like to thank our team members for their hard work and dedication over the past 10 years."

Employees at the casino were informed of the closure on Tuesday. They are being offered severance packages and help finding other jobs.

The closure of the Sands Casino Resort leaves two casinos in Bethlehem: The Parx Casino and Hotel and Mohegan Sun Pocono.
